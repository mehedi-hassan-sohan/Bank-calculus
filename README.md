# README for Calculus Project with Raw JS

Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of basic calculus operations using JavaScript, without relying on external libraries. It covers the following functionalities:

Features

Differentiation:
Calculate derivatives of various functions (e.g., polynomials, trigonometric, exponential, logarithmic)
Implement differentiation rules (e.g., power rule, product rule, chain rule)
Integration:
Calculate definite and indefinite integrals (e.g., using numerical methods like Riemann sums or the trapezoidal rule)
Graphing:
Visualize functions and their derivatives (optional)
